# using

# build
# for me a python code that takesin user input as audio, translates it to text and sends the text to OPENAI models to generate feedback and converts the text to audio for the user to listen to.also include a fetaure where the system listens to a keyword to awaken for use and hiberbates incase user does not give a command to process
# Sure, here is a

# for the user to take use its functions
# Yes, you
# will
# need
# to
# run
# this
# code
# every
# time
# you
# want
# to
# use
# its
# functions.The
# first
# loop in the
# code
# waits
# for a wake word to be heard, which triggers the start of the second loop that processes the user input and generates feedback.Once the second loop is exited, the code returns to the first loop and waits for the wake word to be heard again.So, you will need to run the code each time you want to activate the system and generate feedback for user input.
