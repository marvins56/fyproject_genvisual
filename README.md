GEN-VISUAL (A VISUAL AID FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED)
In almost every country, there are four terms used to describe different levels of vision impairment and blindness.
- partially sighted
- low vision
- legally blind
- totally blind.

**Partially sighted:** a person has partial vision, either in one or both eyes.
Low vision: a severe visual impairment in which visual acuity is 20/70 or poorer in the better-seeing eye and cannot improve with glasses or contacts.
**Legally blind:**  a person has a corrected vision of 20/200 in their best-seeing eye. If visual aids such as glasses can correct a person’s vision to 20/20, they are not considered legally blind.
**Totally blind:**  a complete loss of sight.
All these groups of people suffer inconveniences in their daily life by failing to cope with others without visual disabilities.

Devices or systems are already in place that help these people to do daily life activities like communication, movement, and other activities. Some of the devices in areas am focusing on include
Braille messenger-a braille script-based Sms system for visually impaired people. (Vijaybharathi, D., Arunkumar, B., Balaanand, M., Ponsindhu, T. and Phil, M. (2017))
Smart walking cane SWC
Guide Dogs. And the rest

Most f these are not yet available for our local community as they can only be accessed in certain areas. 
However, from the current technology and devices present I am trying to create a combination of all these features mainly for a few sections by advancing these systems in areas of communication, assistance, and certain classroom activities. 





**SCOPE AREAS**

**COMMUNICATION** 

**Messaging feature** 
The existing device needs manual interfacing with the user, in regards to the Braille messenger-a braille script-based SMS system for visually impaired people. (Vijay Bharathi, D., Arunkumar, B., Balaanand, M., Ponsindhu, T. and Phil, M. (2017)).
My idea
Based on these devices, my idea is to transform the whole process by adding a speech-to-text and text-to-speech feature where instead of using hand to type or read, the speech-to-text (STT) will allow the user to record an audio message that will be converted into text form and sent as a text to the specified user.
Once the desired user receives the message they will text back and once this message is received, it will be converted into speech for the visually impaired person. 
This whole process will be an easy way to communicate with people in distant places or even in case of any conversational desire

**Call feature.** 
My idea was to allow the user to use their voice to command the system to select a given contact in the provided contact list to make the call. This is an easy way out in case someone needs to make a voice call.

Online search content 
Same to this idea, in case a user wants to know maybe news or listen to anything. I wass thinking of integrating an API  (chatgpt)  so that a user can use speech to ask a question. 

**HOW IT WORKS** 

 The user asks  a quetion, the speech istranslated into text, the text is transferred to the api and feedback is recived from the api which is later rendered as peech for the user.

**REALTIME ASSISTANCE** 
My idea. On basis of the smart walking cane and the guide dogs to aid them to move from one place to another. My idea comes in not for long distances but for movement around the users surrounding ( limited range).

Here I was thinking of creating an organization like the company to register users that will aid the visually impaired by directing them through their surroundings. 

**HOW IT WORKS** 

The visually impaired person asks the system through voice interaction to search for an available HELPER who is online. This user automatically connects to the live video stream from the user's camera. What follows Is the helper taking the user through whatever they need to do or where ever they need to walk.  This becomes a more effective way to move with a guaranteed helper than using a walking cane.



(depends)
**CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES** 

**Reading notes**

This is another feature that I hope to make those who wish to be in a classroom environment can use this feature.
The VIP(Visually impaired person) asks the system to record the lecture taking place in audio format which is later saved according to the given title that is later reviewed at the given time x.
This helps the learner to review the lecture as if it’s a live lecture hence reducing the learning time or curve.
Reading documents. written words.
With the help of current technology, we can recognize texts from all kinds of written information. In case the user wants to read the user has glasses with a camera that will take a pic and translate the text to speech for the user.
